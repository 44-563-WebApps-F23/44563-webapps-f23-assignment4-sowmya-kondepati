  <p>I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?</p>

  <h5 class="Alving">MRS. ALVING</h5>
  <P>Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
  </P>

  <h5 class="Mander">MANDERS.</h5>
  <P>I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
    morsel of dinner.</P>

  <h5 class="Alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5>
  <P class="direction">[Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.]</P>
  <P>Nor I.
    But what is to be done now?</P>


  <h5 class="Mander">MANDERS.</h5>
  <P>Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
    utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</P>

  <h5 class="Alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5>
  <P>I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.</P>

  <h5 class="Mander">MANDERS</h5>
  <P>No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
    nevertheless.</P>
  </p>
  <h5 class="Aliving ">MRS. ALVING</h5>
  <p>It was my purchase-money. I do not choose that that money
    should pass into Oswald's hands. My son shall have everything from
    me--everything.</p>

  <p class="direction">[OSWALD ALVING enters through the second door to the right; he has taken
    of his hat and overcoat in the hall.]
  </p>

  <h5 class="Aliving"> MRS. ALVING.</h5>
  <p class="direction">Going towards him.] Are you back again already? My dear,
    dear boy!</p>
