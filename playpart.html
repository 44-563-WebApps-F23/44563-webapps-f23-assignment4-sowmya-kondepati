        MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
     </p>
     <p>MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out. </p>

    <p>MANDERS. I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
        morsel of dinner. </p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING. [Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.] Nor I.
        But what is to be done now?</p>

    <p>MANDERS. Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
        utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p>

    <p>MRS. ALVING. I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done</p>
    <p>MRS. ALVING. Not now, at any rate. </p>
